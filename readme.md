# Docker Compose Example 

This is not an example of how to use compose, but to show a weird difference
between versions.

Using a Dockerfile in a different place than the build context, 1.18.0 works
fine, but 1.20.1 gives an error.

# How to test:

1. Clone this repo to a machine running docker-compose.
1. Run `runtest.sh` at the command prompt.
